# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Introduction

This subdirectory focuses on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the `Country-data.csv` dataset. PCA is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction while preserving as much of the data's variability as possible.

## Algorithm Description

PCA transforms the data into a new coordinate system where the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.

Key steps involved in PCA:

1. Standardizing the data.
2. Computing the covariance matrix.
3. Calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix to identify the principal components.
4. Projecting the original data on the principal components to reduce the dimensions.

## Theoretical Foundation

PCA is founded on the linear algebra theory concerning eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It seeks to project the original features onto a smaller set of orthogonal features that explain most of the original data's variance. The mathematical basis involves solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix to find these new features.

## Applications

- **Data Visualization**: Simplifying high-dimensional data into 2D or 3D plots.
- **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Identifying the most meaningful features.
- **Noise Reduction**: Eliminating noise from data.
- **Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms**: Enhancing the performance of algorithms by reducing computational overhead.
