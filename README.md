# INDE 577 - Data Science & Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to showcasing implementations of various machine learning algorithms, focusing on both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to provide a comprehensive educational resource for students, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field of data science and machine learning.

Through detailed examples, theoretical explanations, and practical implementations, this repository aims to illustrate the significance of these techniques in understanding data patterns, making predictions, and uncovering insights from unlabelled data.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main subdirectories: `Supervised Learning` and `Unsupervised Learning`, each containing specific algorithms relevant to the category. Below is an overview of what each subdirectory includes:

- **Supervised Learning**: Contains examples and implementations of algorithms like the Perceptron, Gradient Descent, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Ensemble Methods.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Focuses on algorithms such as K-Means, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and DBSCAN, showcasing their application in data science.

Each algorithm subdirectory includes:

- A detailed `README.md` explaining the algorithm's theory, applications, and relevance.
- A Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) demonstrating the algorithm's implementation on a selected dataset, including data preprocessing, application of the algorithm, results, and detailed analysis.

## Navigation

- To navigate to a specific algorithm, browse through the `Supervised Learning` or `Unsupervised Learning` directories.
- For theoretical background and application examples, refer to the `README.md` in each algorithm's subdirectory.
- For code implementations and practical demonstrations, open the Jupyter Notebooks provided.

## Significance of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques are pillars of machine learning and data science. Supervised learning allows us to predict outcomes and make informed decisions based on past data, essential for applications like facial recognition, spam detection, and market forecasting. On the other hand, unsupervised learning helps us discover hidden patterns and intrinsic structures in data, valuable in anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and feature reduction for complex datasets.

These techniques not only empower us to make sense of vast amounts of data but also enable the development of intelligent systems that can learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks, ultimately driving innovation across industries.
