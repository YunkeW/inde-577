# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on the Wine Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to the Wine dataset. KNN is a versatile algorithm used for classification and regression that relies on feature similarity.

## Theoretical Foundation

KNN operates on the basic principle of similarity metrics â€” it assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, it looks at the K points in the feature space that are closest to the input point and makes decisions based on their classifications.

- **Classification**: KNN assigns a class to the input point based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors.
- **Regression**: KNN predicts a value based on the average of the values of its nearest neighbors.

The algorithm has a lazy learning nature as it does not build a model explicitly but rather stores the instances of the training data. The classification/regression is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point.

## Applications

- **Pattern Recognition**: Often used for image and video recognition.
- **Recommender Systems**: KNN can fuel recommendation engines by finding items that are similar to the user's liked items.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Classifying patient outcomes based on historical patient data.
- **Finance**: Predicting credit ratings by comparing client profiles with historic data.
