# Decision Tree Classifier for Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This subdirectory contains all the resources and files necessary to understand and utilize a decision tree classifier for predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The decision tree model is a fundamental yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Theoretical Foundation of Decision Trees

### What is a Decision Tree?

A decision tree is a graphical representation of all the possible solutions to a decision based on certain conditions. In machine learning, it is used to predict the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).

### How Does a Decision Tree Work?

A decision tree makes decisions by splitting data into branches, which represent the possible outcomes of a series of related choices. Starting from a root node, the data is split according to certain feature thresholds, leading to decision nodes and eventually leaf nodes where the final predictions are made.

### Algorithms Behind Decision Trees

- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** uses the Gini index as a metric for classification tasks and mean squared error for regression.
- **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)** and **C4.5** use entropy and information gain to make splits.

## Applications of Decision Trees

- **Classification**: From determining loan approval to diagnosing medical conditions, decision trees can classify instances into distinct categories.
- **Regression**: Decision trees can predict continuous variables, such as house prices or stock values.
- **Feature Importance**: They inherently perform feature selection, which can be very useful in exploratory analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: The dataset directory, where the Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`) is stored.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for preprocessing data, training the decision tree model, and predicting outcomes.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks that detail the exploratory data analysis, model training process, and evaluation.
- `models/`: This folder stores the serialized models trained on the Titanic dataset.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading, explaining the project's purpose and contents.
