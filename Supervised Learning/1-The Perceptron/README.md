# Perceptron Model Implementation

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of a single-layer Perceptron, a fundamental type of neural network, to classify sonar signals as either reflected by a metal cylinder (mine) or a rock. The Perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks and serves as the basis for understanding more complex networks.

## Theoretical Foundation

The Perceptron is a type of linear classifier, an algorithm that classifies input by making a linear combination of weights and feature inputs. Developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, it is based on a threshold transfer function. The Perceptron makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

### Learning Rule

The key to the Perceptron is its learning rule, which updates the weights:

- Weights are adjusted through a simple rule of reducing the error between predicted and actual classifications.
- The update is governed by the equation `w = w + learning_rate * (expected - predicted) * x`, where `w` is the weight vector, `x` is the feature vector, and `expected` versus `predicted` provide the error term necessary for correction.

## Applications

Initially designed for binary classification tasks, Perceptrons are foundational in fields such as:

- Object recognition and classification in computer vision,
- Basic voice recognition,
- Text classification where documents need to be classified into categories.

## Dataset Description

The Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks dataset used in this project comprises patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder and rocks under similar conditions. It includes:

- **208 instances** total, each with 60 attributes representing energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period.
- **Binary classification target**: 'M' for mine and 'R' for rock.

## Implementation Details

The Jupyter Notebook `Perceptron.ipynb` in this repository includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizing the dataset to ensure the model receives well-formulated data.
2. **Model Training**: Implementing the learning rule and adjusting the weights based on the training data.
3. **Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision to evaluate model performance.

## Results

- The performance of the Perceptron is documented in terms of accuracy and other metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of the model in distinguishing between sonar signals reflected off different types of surfaces.

## Conclusion

This Perceptron implementation demonstrates basic neural network principles on a real-world dataset. While simple, the Perceptron lays the groundwork for more sophisticated learning algorithms and systems.
